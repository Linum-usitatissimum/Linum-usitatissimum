Hi, Iâ€™m @Linum-usitatissimum, my moniker is the scientific name for the flax plant.
 
I'm currently working my way through/studying four courses:
  -   The Odin Project
  -   freeCodeCamp
  -   appacademy.io
  -   Full Stack Open
 
I'm also currently a zygote at all things CS related, but will get there one day by continuing to plug away at this.
 
I am autistic. And a millenial.

Some of my obsessions/hobbies are: learning Latin, because I like to read old books and love languages. I like many old things, period. Fossils. Ancient burial garments.
Old styles of painting. Archeological finds. So on and so forth. Old people. Old techniques for manufacturing things, like creating oil paint by hand, spinning fibers by hand for the purpose of weaving fabrics.
 
Sometimes I do art, preference is for realism and some surrealism.
When I do create art, I do oil painting in the tradition of the Old Dutch Masters, fine graphite portraiture, designing patterns for garments, and 
creating garments (specifically art-wear). 

I enjoy reading research papers, journal articles and huge (and small) textbooks. For fun. Because learning new things is fun.
 
And at times I like to dabble in electronics and build cool stuff. 

Anyways, enough wording from myself, 

Welcome to my profile,
 
Salvete et Valete,

Linum
